## Installation
There will be no libraries to run the code beyond the in-built libraries in Python version 3.

## Project Motivation
I am interested in the most streamed artists and songs of 2023 by Spotify. I want to answer three questions:
1. How did artists fare across various platforms in the year?
2. Which songs had the best performance across all platforms?
3. How have audio features of songs varied over the years?

## File Descriptions
The code for this project is in a single Jupyter notebook. The dataset is also provided in CSV format. The code is in sequential manner
following the data science process.

## Results
I share the findings of this project in a post available here.
